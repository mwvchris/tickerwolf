That error —

```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, unlink '/home/chris/Sites/websites/tickerwolf.ai/node_modules/.vite/deps/@inertiajs_core.js'
```

— means **Vite is trying to delete or modify a file it doesn’t have permission to access**. This is usually caused by incorrect file ownership or permission issues in the `node_modules/.vite` directory.

Let’s fix it step-by-step 👇

---

### 🧹 1. Clear Vite’s cache

Sometimes Vite’s pre-bundled dependencies get corrupted or left with bad permissions.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
```

Then restart the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If that doesn’t work, continue below.

---

### 🔑 2. Fix file ownership and permissions

Check which user owns the project files:

```bash
ls -ld /home/chris/Sites/websites/tickerwolf.ai
ls -ld /home/chris/Sites/websites/tickerwolf.ai/node_modules/.vite
```

If you see files owned by `root` or another user, fix ownership:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/chris/Sites/websites/tickerwolf.ai
```

Then set correct permissions:

```bash
chmod -R u+rw node_modules/.vite
```

---

### 🔄 3. Reinstall dependencies (if needed)

If the issue persists, delete all dependencies and reinstall cleanly:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### ⚡ 4. If you’re using WSL or Docker

If this project is running in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a containerized environment, file permissions can sometimes mismatch between host and guest systems. In that case:

* Try running `npm run dev` **inside the same environment** where `node_modules` were installed.
* Or delete and reinstall dependencies inside that environment.

Would you like to tell me whether you’re running this on plain Linux, WSL, or Docker? I can tailor the fix for your setup.
